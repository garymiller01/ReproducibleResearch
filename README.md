Reproducible Research
====================

This repository contains the R Markdown and other files describing
two analyses performed as part of the 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata">Reproducible Research</a> 
course in John Hopkins Univerity's Data Science Specialization.  

The <a href="http://rpubs.com/garymiller01/24931">first</a> is an analysis of 
movement data recorded by a personal activity monitoring device.

The <a href="http://rpubs.com/garymiller01/25518">second</a> attempts to 
identify the types of storm events that have caused the most damage in terms of 
property and human life in the United States.  The data comes from the NOAA's
National Climactic Data Center.
